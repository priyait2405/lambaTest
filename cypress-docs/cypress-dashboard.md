## Steps To Integrate LambdaTest With Cypress Dashboard

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on LambdaTest platform ( if not, this article [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on LambdaTest), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update LambdaTest Cypress CLI
---

- Before getting started, you would have to update the **lambdatest-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g lambdatest-cypress-cli
```

- The CLI version should be the latest i.e. is 2.3.0. You can check the CLI version by running the below command.
